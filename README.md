Hi guys, yesterday i was about to send my wp site live (non-private setting) www......financial.com 
The existing home page was somehow defaulting to an obsolete page l no longer needed
 so I tried to change both URL site addresses (shown below) on the Generals Settings page from www....financial.com to www.......financial.com/home
When I hit ‘save changes’ the below error message appeared and I have been locked out ever since.  Every time I attempt to log-in at http://www.....financial.com/home/wp-login.php  I get the same error message.
My site was set to go live yesterday can you kindly offer any advice?
Kind regards
